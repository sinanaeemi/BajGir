This is an under development ransomware for windows with a control panel. The files are encrypted using a AES-256 key generated for the specific client. The keys are then sent to the control panel along side the hardware key using a public-key RSA-2048. Where if the hardware key is set to paid status the user can decrypt the files on his/her computer.
